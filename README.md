## Pipeline
The project was built with [CI](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) / [CD](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment/). For this project we are using continuous deployment.
There is a [circle-ci pipeline](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/meandor/tower-of-fate) that takes care of most
of the automation. To learn more about delivery pipelines please visit: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DeploymentPipeline.html

## Deployment
The project is deployed in the AWS Cloud with [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/d2d0bc61-3d2d-452a-824a-45daa4ed3a11).
It is using the free tier, which means that initially the project might load a bit but should then work as expected.
